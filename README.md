# Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator
Here is my Rubik's Cube Solver and Simulator! This is a project that started for me back in the summer of 2021 for a Programming in Java Class at UC Berkely's ATDP. Our final was to simulate a rubik's cube with an array list of 2D arrays. However, having learned how to solve a rubik's cube that summer and watching a video online of an MIT robot solving a rubik's cube in 0.38 seconds, I was inspired to develop my own program that could solve a rubik's cube using the beginner's method which I know. This project culminated in over a year's worth of work, mostly on the solving algorithm, but I finally managed to get it to work! The original code shows the original simulation of the Rubik's Cube as sort of the "Net" of a cube where each letter represents a color. The 3D simulation gives a better visualization of what the solving algorithm is actually doing and is why I decided to implement it into my code using Processing.
